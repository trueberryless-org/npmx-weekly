## Launchpad: The Weekly Flight Summary

Before we dive into the technical telemetry of our recent PRs and Bluesky posts, let’s take a look at the major milestones currently defining our trajectory.

<TopicSection
  title="New Adapters: npmx for VS Code"
  paragraphs="We’ve officially extended our orbit into the editor! The npmx VS Code extension is now live, bringing real-time package insights, version resolution, and documentation links directly into your workspace. It’s designed to bridge the gap between your manifest files and the npmx platform without ever leaving your code."
  sources={[
    {"platform": "github", "url": "https://github.com/npmx-dev/vscode-npmx"},
    {"platform": "VS Code", "url": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=npmx-dev.vscode-npmx"},
    {"platform": "Docs", "url": "https://docs.npmx.dev/guide/vscode-extension"}
  ]}

<TopicSection
  title="Celestial Milestone: 1,000 GitHub Stars"
  paragraphs="Our community galaxy just got a whole lot brighter. This week, npmx surpassed 1,000 stars on GitHub! This milestone is a testament to the incredible support from the OSS community and the collective energy driving this project forward. We're honored to have so many developers joining us on this voyage."

<TopicSection
  title="Predicting the Future: From Bug to Feature"
  paragraphs="What started as a Discord observation by ematipico about trailing download charts quickly evolved into a platform upgrade. After Graphieros bridged the gap from feedback to a GitHub issue, they not only stabilized the historical data views but also implemented an intelligent forecasting model. Now, npmx doesn't just show you where a package has been — it predicts where it’s going."
